    # Resilience Logic:
    # 1. Skip Dependabot PRs: They do not have access to repository secrets by default.
    # 2. Secret Availability Check: Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is present. This prevents the 
    #    workflow from failing when triggered from forks or environments where secrets 
    #    are not configured.
